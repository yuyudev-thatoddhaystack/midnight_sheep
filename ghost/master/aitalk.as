talk RandomTalk {
    \s[7]I shouldn’t have stayed up so late watching TV.\w4.\w4.\w8 I like having the static noise on while I sleep,\w4 though.\w8

    \s[3]I skipped out on drinking caffeinated soda after school today and I still ended up waking up in the middle of the night.\w8 Sigh.\w8

talk RandomTalk {
    \s[0]Are you ever so tired that you end up surpassing being tired and feel awake again?\w8\s[7] That happened to me yesterday in class.\w8\n\n\w8Maybe I’ve just surpassed needing eight hours of sleep a night and now I can survive off a lot less,\w4 and that’s why I keep waking up in the middle of the night.\w8\w8\n\n.\w4.\w4.\w8\s[3]Yeah OK,\w4 or maybe I just have chronic insomnia.\w8
